- For FastAPI apps:
   - By convention, all endpoints should be decorated with the response_model and an operation ID (in camel case, e.g. `listEvalIssues`). GET endpoints which return lists/paginated lists should be named as list{plural object in camel case}, for single objects, `read{singular object in camel case}`, e.g. `readEvalIssue`.
   - When declaring endpoint dependencies, use the Annotated syntax, e.g., `db: Annotated[Session, Depends(get_db)]`, NOT the `= Depends(get_db)` default argument syntax.
   - Words in urls should be separated by underscores, not dashes. E.g. `issue_histories` not `issue-histories`.
